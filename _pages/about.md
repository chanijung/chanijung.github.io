Hi! I’m currently a visiting researcher in the [Language Technologies Institute at CMU](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu), working with [Maarten Sap](https://maartensap.com). I recently completed an MS in [School of Computing at KAIST](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr), where I was advised by [Alice Oh](https://aliceoh9.github.io).

My research interests lie in human-centered NLP and computational social science. During my master’s studies, I have focused on key yet under-explored facets of socio-cultural intelligence in language models, including cultural sensitivity, theory of mind, and question-asking abilities.
